## Idea
For our project, we will be using the Spotify API to create a party playlist generator.
We plan on utilizing machine learning techniques to pull popular songs from a specified genre to compile a multiple-hour playlist.
The website will allow users to sign in to their Spotify account, specify a genre, and have a new party playlist automatically added to their account.

## Technologies
- `React` We will use React as our reactive, front-end framework.
- `Node.js` We will use an Express Node.js server for our back-end computation.
- `Spotify API` We will use Spotify's open-source API as the source of song data.
- `Tenserflow.js` We will use Tensorflow.js to conduct machine learning regression tests on popular songs.
